# Delaware Flash Flood Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts high-risk flash flood areas in Delaware using machine learning. It integrates FEMA flood maps with socio-demographic data to identify vulnerable communities.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes:
- **Satellite Precipitation Data** (CMORPH Climate Data)
- **Land-Use & Elevation Data** (NOAA & USGS)
- **Socio-Demographic Data** (CDC SVI Index)
- **FEMA Flood Maps** (Public Data)

ðŸ“Œ **Data Access**:  
Since data is stored in Google Drive, download it manually (links are also provided in the notebook).

## Methodology
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing and interpolation for flood-risk assessment.
- **Model Used**: Decision Tree Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
